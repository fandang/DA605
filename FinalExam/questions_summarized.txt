* Bootstrapping:
-----------------------------
- size n sample.  
- keep taking size n samples with replacement.

1) 15 pts: *** 1.5 pts each: ***
1.1 matrix rank
1.2 find reduced row-echelon form
1.3 Defone orthonormal basis vectors. 
	Please write down at least one orthonormal basis for the 4-dimensional vector space R4. 
1.4 Find characteristic polynomial of a vector
1.5 Find a matrix's Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (note: you can get complex eigenvectors)
1.6 Given a column stochastic matrix of links between URLs, what can you say about the PageRank of this set of URLS?
	How is it related to eigen decomposition?
1.7 Assuming that we are repeatedly sampling sets of numbers (each set is of size n)
	from an unknown probability density function. What can we say about the mean
	value of each set?	
1.8 What is the derivative of ex sin2(x)? **** it says (sin x)^2 - dont miss that!!!
1.9 deriv
1.10 Integral

2) 15 pts: *** 5 pts each ***
2.1 ...
2.2 Principal Components Analysis by performing an SVD on the 4
	independent variables (with mpg as the dependent variable)
	and select the top 2 directions.
2.3 Bootstrapping: start with n data points and repeatedly sample many times ***with replacement.***
	Each time, we generate a candidate data set of size n from the original data set.
	It can be easily shown that any particular data set generated by sampling n points from an original set of size n covers roughly 63.2% of the original data set.	
	Using probability theory and limits, please prove that this is
	true. After that, write a program to perform this sampling and show that the empirical
	observation also agrees this.
	
3) 20 pts: perform a Multivariate Linear Regression analysis using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
The data set consists of two predictor variables and one
response variable. The predictor variables are living area in square feet and number of
bedrooms. The response variable is the price of the house. You have 47 data points in
total.
Since both the number of rooms and the living area are in dierent units, it makes it
hard to compare them in relative terms. One way to compensate for this is to standardize
the variables. In order to standardize, you estimate the mean and standard deviation of
each variable and then compute new versions of these variables. For instance, if you have
a variable x, then then standardized version of x is xstd = (x ?? )= where  and  are
the mean and standard deviation of x, respectively.
