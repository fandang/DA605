## Sampling: When do we use it
- We want to simulate a complex system and need to know what can happen as the system operates
- Used in Economic forecasting, Financial modeling, Statistical Physics, Machine Learning
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is a well-used simulation tool (You might have encountered it in your 401(k) modeling)

## Some popular sampling techniques
- Inverse Transform Sampling
- Rejection Sampling
- Slice Sampling

## Inverse Transform Sampling
- Start with the CDF (cumulative distribution function)
    + Integral of the PDF
- Invert it
- Uniformly sample a value from [0,1]. Interpret as a probability
- Use the inverse to find the corresponding value of the random variable

## Triangular PDF

## Inverse Transform Sampling
- Given $f(x) = x, x \in [0,1]$ and $f(x)=2-x,x \in (1,2]$
- We get F(x), the CDF as 
    + $F(x) = \frac{x^2}{2}, x \in [0,1]$ and $F(x) = 2x - \frac{x^2}{2} - 1, x \in (1,2]$
- From this, we can compute an inverse function of F(x), $F^{-1}(x)$ such that $F^{-1}F(x) = x$
- A little bit of Algebra shows that we get the inverse function of the CDF as
    + $F^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{2y}, y \in [0,0.5]$ and $F^{-1}(y) = 2 - \sqrt{2(1-y)}, y \in(0.5,1]$.

## Inverse Transform Sampling
Now, to sample from this inverse CDF, we can do the following:
```{r}
invcdf <- function(y) {
    if (y >= 0 && y <= 1) {
        ret <- ifelse(y < 0.5,sqrt(2*y),2-sqrt(2*(1-y)))
    }
}

sample1 <- sapply(runif(20000),invcdf)
sdf = data.frame(sample1)
```

## Inverse Transform Sampling
```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
print(qplot(sample1,data=sdf,geom="density"))
```

## Rejection Sampling
- Choose a function M(x) that is strictly larger than f(x) over the range 
- Uniformly sample (x,y) over the range of x and y
- Accept all samples that are under the curve of f(x) and reject all samples that are above f(x)

## Rejection Sampling
```{r}
sample.x = runif(20000,0,2)
accept = c()
fx <- function(x) {if (x >= 0 && x <= 2) {y <- ifelse(x <=1, x, 2-x)} else {y <- 0}}

# dnorm(sample.x[i],0.5,0.175)
for(i in 1:length(sample.x)){
 U = runif(1, 0, 1)
 if(dunif(sample.x[i], 0, 2)*3*U <= fx(sample.x[i])) {
   accept[i] = 'Y'
 }
 else if(dunif(sample.x[i], 0, 2)*3*U > fx(sample.x[i])) {
  accept[i] = 'N'
 }
}

T = data.frame(sample.x, accept = factor(accept, levels= c('Y','N')))
```

## Rejection Sampling
We can plot the results along with the true distribution with the following code.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(T[,1][T$accept=='Y'], breaks = seq(0,2,0.02), freq = FALSE, main = 'Histogram of X', xlab = 'X')
x=seq(0,1,0.02)
lines(x, fx(x))
x=seq(1,2,0.02)
lines(x, fx(x))
```

## Rejection Sampling
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(qplot(sample.x, data = T, geom = 'density', color = accept))
```

## Rejection Sampling
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(qplot(sample.x, data = T, geom = 'histogram', fill = accept, binwidth=0.02))
```

## Slice Sampling
- First select an $\hat{x}$ from the range of f(x)
- Then, vertically choose a $\hat{y}$ that is between 0 and $f(\hat{x})$
- Draw a horizontal slice at this $\hat{y}$
- Uniformly sample between $\hat{x}_{min}$ and $\hat{x}_{max}$ at this $\hat{y}$. 
- Repeat with this as the new $\hat{x}$

## Slice Sampling in Action
Extracted from the mcmc tutorial (part of the diversitree package)
```{r}
library(diversitree)
make.mvn <- function(mean, vcv) {
    logdet <- as.numeric(determinant(vcv, TRUE)$modulus)
    tmp <- length(mean) * log(2 * pi) + logdet
    vcv.i <- solve(vcv)

    function(x) {
        dx <- x - mean
        -(tmp + rowSums((dx %*% vcv.i) * dx))/2
    }
}
```

## Slice Sampling in Action
Our target distribution has mean 0, and a VCV with positive covariance between the two parameters.

```{r}
vcv <- matrix(c(1, 0.25, 0.25, 0.75), 2, 2)
lik <- make.mvn(c(0, 0), vcv)
```
Sample 10,000 points from the distribution, starting at c(0, 0).

```{r}
set.seed(1)
samples <- mcmc(lik, c(0, 0), 20000, 1, print.every = 10000)
```

## Slice Sampling in Action
The marginal distribution of V1 (the first axis of the distribution) should be a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
curve(dnorm, xlim = range(samples$X1), ylim = c(0, 0.5), col = "red")
hist(samples$X1, 30, add = TRUE, freq = FALSE)
```

## Slice Sampling with Triangular PDF
Try with Triangular PDF
```{r}
set.seed(1)
lik <- function(x) { if (x >= 0 && x < 1) log(x) else log(2-x) }
samples <- mcmc(lik, 0.0001, 20000, 1, lower=0.0001, upper=1.9999, print.every = 20000)
```

## Slice Sampling with Triangular PDF
```{r,echo=FALSE}
#curve(fx,from=0,to=1,add=T,xlim=c(0,2),col='red')
curve(fx,from=0,to=2,add=T,xlim=c(0,2),col='red')
hist(samples$par, 30, add=T, freq = FALSE)
```

## Using built-in R Sample function to do this without knowing any sampling
If you don't want to know how to do these sampling yourself, you can always just use the samp function in R
```{r}
xgrid=seq(0,2,by=0.01)
fxgrid <- sapply(xgrid,fx)
nx <- sample(xgrid,10000,replace=TRUE,prob=fxgrid)
```

## Compare sampling from a function and sampling from a PDF
```{r,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
hist(fxgrid,30,freq=F)
hist(nx,30,freq=F)
```

## R one liner
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
nx <- sample(seq(0,2,by=0.01),10000,replace=TRUE,prob=sapply(seq(0,2,by=0.01),function(x) { if (x > 0 && x <= 2) {    y <- ifelse(x <=1, x, 2-x)  } else {y <- 0 }}))
hist(nx,30,freq=F)
```
